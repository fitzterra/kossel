Firmware
========
This directory is for hosting one, or possibly multiple, git subtree(s) for
firmware options.

It seems that both Marlin and Repetier firmware are well mature, but that
Repetier source is better structured and easier to work with for newbies.

In addition, the [GT2560][] board from GeeeTech being used for control seems to
have it's own idiosyncrasies, but that there is already some support for it in a
forked Repetier repo.

----------
This is the Repetier mods for the GeeeTech G2 delta printer by ezrec. This seems
to be the closest and quickest method to get to understand and get Repetier
working on the [GT2560][] board.
